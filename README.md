This is some good code. I am curious, if you were to put in a subjective rather than object question in what woul be teh output? For example: "Who performed the worst at the US Open in 2022?" I thnk it would probably output "I don't know," or something along the lines of, "There's no way to accutrately tell". But, it might have an answer, idk I'm curious
